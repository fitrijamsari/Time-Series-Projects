# Time Series Forecasting Projects

Welcome to my Time Series Forecasting Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of my time series forecasting related projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

## Projects

### 1. Sale Prediction using ARIMA & SARIMAX

- **Description:** This project focuses on forecasting sales figures using time series analysis techniques such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). By analyzing historical sales data, these models aim to provide accurate predictions for future sales trends. The project involves fitting ARIMA and SARIMA models to the sales data, evaluating their performance, and comparing the forecasting capabilities of each model.
- **Technologies Used:** ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **Results:** Both ARIMA and SARIMA models were applied to the sales data. While ARIMA captures the non-seasonal patterns, SARIMA incorporates seasonal effects for more accurate predictions. The models were evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The SARIMA model outperformed ARIMA, demonstrating superior forecasting accuracy for seasonal sales data.
